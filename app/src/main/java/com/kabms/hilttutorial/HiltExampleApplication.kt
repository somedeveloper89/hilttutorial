 * Step 4:

 * with @HiltAndroidApp.
 * @HiltAndroidApp triggers Hilt's code generation, including a base class for
 * your application that serves as the application-level dependency container.
 * This generated Hilt component is attached to the Application object's lifecycle
 * and provides dependencies to it. Additionally, it is the parent component of
 * the app, which means that other components can access the dependencies that
